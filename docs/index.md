## Worldbuilder
Worldbuilder is your all-in-one campaign management and worldbuilding toolkit, seamlessly integrated in [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com).

Build immersive worlds by creating and linking articles for everything in your game: sessions, quests, characters, locations, and more. Craft an expanding web of lore and let your players explore the connections, or keep it secret until the time is right.

Highly customizable, Worldbuilder puts you in full control. Decide exactly what information matters for each article, and fine-tune how this information is displayed for you, specific players, or for everyone.

To unlock the full power of Worldbuilder, a subscription to the [Material Foundry Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/materialfoundry) at the Material Apprentice tier (or higher) is required.
Want to try it first? Give the free [demo](./demo.md) version a try.
