## Worldbuilder
Worldbuilder is a worldbuilding and campaign management module that is running completely within your [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) world.

Worldbuilder allows you (or your players) to create articles to describe, for example, gaming sessions, quests, characters or locations. Link these articles together to create an interconnected web of all the relevant things in your world.

Worldbuilder is highly customizable, allowing you to decide what information is important for what article, and what information should be hidden for everyone, or only for select players.
