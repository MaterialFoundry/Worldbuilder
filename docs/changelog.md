Changes between module versions are documented here.<br>

??? changelog "v1.0.2 - 18-10-2025"
    ### Additions
    * You can now open Worldbuilder articles through map notes. Dropping articles on a scene will automatically create a map note.
    * You can now drag Foundry documents (actors, items, etc) onto a "Article" or "Article/Text" sidebar option.
    * Added hotkeys to open/close the Worldbuilder application (Alt+W) and to close all Worldbuilder windows (Alt+A), can be configured in Foundry's Controls Configuration.
    * Added a control button to open Worldbuilder.
    * Added new tab visibility modes for the main application: Besides showing and hiding tabs, you can make them GM-only, or hide them when a player has no relevant articles that they can see.
    * Added a new Data Id setting, which allows you to share your Worldbuilder data between different worlds on the same server.
    * Article pages and images can now be made secret or hidden.
    * The entire article sidebar can be made secret or hidden.

    ### Fixes
    * Fixed UI bug for the main app tabs when using Carolingian UI.
    * Fixed issue with user notes not saving.
    * Fixed an issue when trying to clear data in v12 that would prevent Worldbuilder from loading.
    * Clear Data button now works in v13.
    * Fixed issue where linked documents in articles could not be deleted.
    * If there were too many article pages or images that the page/image buttons would be wider than the enclosing element, the left-most button(s) would be (parially) unreachable. This is now fixed.
    * Forbidden Lands: The article images section would not be displayed if there were no images configured. This is now fixed.
    * Asset folder on Sqyre servers should now be accessible through the Worldbuilder file picker.

    ### Other Changes
    * Changed Worldbuilder icon (in Settings sidebar) to a globe.
