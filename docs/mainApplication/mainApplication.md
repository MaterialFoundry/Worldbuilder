The main application of Worldbuilder is the starting point for everything you do with the module. It shows all articles, categorized by article types, allows you to open and create articles, and more.

To open the application, you have 4 options:

* Control Button: Click the Worldbuilder (:fontawesome-solid-globe:) control button (on the left of the screen)
* Hotkey: Use the hotkey `Alt+W`, this hotkey can be configured in Contigure Controls in the Game Settings sidebar tab (:material-cogs:)
* Sidebar: Head the Game Settings sidebar tab (:material-cogs:), look for the Material Foundry section and press the :fontawesome-solid-globe: Worldbuilder button
* API: Call `worldbuilder.api.open()`

## Navigating through the App
The application can be divided into 3 parts:

* <b>Header</b>: This is the very top of the application. Here you will find:
    * :fontawesome-solid-circle-question:: help button, clicking this will open relevant documentation. Almost every Worldbuilder application/window will have such a button.
    * :fontawesome-solid-x:: close button, clicking this will close the application.
    * <img src="../../img/article/playEditButton.png">: (Home tab only) clicking this will switch between Play and Edit mode, this will be discussed below.
* <b>Content</b>: This is the main part of the application which will show the content based on which tab is open.
* <b>Tabs</b>: The tabs on the right allow you to navigate through the application
    * <b>[Home](./home.md):</b> Can be used to search for articles, display a welcome message or information that you or your players want easy access to, and gives each user a place to write down notes. Can be edited by clicking the Edit Mode slider.
    * <b>Favorites:</b> Displays articles that have been favorited.
    * <b>[Articles](./articles.md):</b> There are multiple article tabs available, each for specific [article](../articles/articles.md) types. Each tab will have a search bar to find articles, a button to create new articles, and a list of the articles of that type.
    * <b>Widgets:</b> Similar to the article tabs, but for [widgets](../widgets/widgets.md).
    * <b>Tags:</b> Similar to the article tabs, but displays [Tags](../tags.md).
    * <b>[Settings](../settings.md):</b> Used for configuring the module.
