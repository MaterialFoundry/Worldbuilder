Widgets are objects that can be inserted into an article as an interactive element, or they can be used on their own.

### Widget Types

The following widget types are available:

* <b>[Map](./map.md):</b> Displays a map (or any other kind of image or video) onto which you can place clickable icons and labels

### Inserting into an Article
See [here](../articles/pages.md#page-inserts) for more info on inserting widgets.

### Stand-Alone
You can use a widget stand-alone (without inserting it into an article). Simply open the widget like you would open an article.

#### Header Buttons
When the widget is opened stand-alone, the widget has the following header buttons (at the top of the window):

* <img src="../../img/article/playEditButton.png"> Mode Switch: To switch between [play and edit mode](../articles/articles.md#playedit-mode)
* :fontawesome-solid-eye: Show Players: Show the widget to your players, see [here](../articles/articles.md#sharing-articles)
* :fontawesome-solid-passport: Copy UUID: Copy the UUID of the widget to the clipboard
* :fontawesome-solid-circle-question: Help: Open this documentation
* :fontawesome-solid-x: Close Window: Close the widget

### Creating, Deleting & Duplicating Widgets
You can create, delete or duplicate a widget in the widget tab of the [main application](../mainApplication/mainApplication.md).
