Articles are what Worldbuilder is all about.<br>
Articles describe characters, places, items, etc. They display relevant information and images, and articles can link to other articles or Foundry documents (such as actors or scenes).<br>
This allows you to create a comprehensive database of your world.

### Play/Edit Mode
A worldbuilder article has 2 modes:

1. Play Mode: Articles can only be viewed
2. Edit Mode: Articles can be edited

You can switch between these modes by pressing the slider at the top-right of the article.<br>
Only players who are the [owner](#ownership) of an article can edit it.

### Sharing Articles
<div class="imgContainer"><img src="../../img/article/showArticle.png"></div>
You can share articles with other users by pressing the :fontawesome-solid-eye: icon.<br>
This will open the article for the selected users, regardless of the [ownership level](#ownership) of the user. [Secrets](#secrets) will not be shown if the user is not allowed to.

<div class="clear"></div>

### Secrets
Secrets are part of an article that are only visible to users with Owner or Observer [ownership](#ownership).<br>
You can insert a secret into text sections by setting the text type to Secret (under Block), see [here](./textEditing.md#secrets) for more info.<br>
Data in the [sidebar](#sidebar) can also be made secret, as is explained in that section.

### Ownership
<div class="imgContainer"><img src="../../img/article/ownershipConfig.png"></div>
The ownership level of an article determines what a user can or cannot do with an article.<br>
You can configure an article's ownership by right-clicking an article in the [main application](../mainApplication.md) and selecting "Configure Ownership".

A default ownership can be configured on the "All Players" line, or the ownership can be configured for each player individually.

The following ownership levels are available:

| Ownership level   | Article is visible| Can see secrets   | Can edit          |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| None              | :material-close:  | :material-close:  | :material-close:  |
| Limited           | :material-check:  | :material-close:  | :material-close:  |
| Observer          | :material-check:  | :material-check:  | :material-close:  |
| Owner             | :material-check:  | :material-check:  | :material-check:  |
