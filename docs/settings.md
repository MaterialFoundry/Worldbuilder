The settings tab of the [main application](./mainApplication/mainApplication.md) gives access to the Worldbuilder settings.

## Tab Configuration
<div class="imgContainer"><img src="../img/settings/tabConfiguration.png"></div>

The Tab Configuration section allows you to configure the tabs of the [main application](./mainApplication/mainApplication.md), and it allows you to open the [sidebar options configuration](./articles/sidebarOptions.md) for the relevant articles (:material-format-columns:).

#### Tab Name
You can change the name of a tab by click on one of the names. This allows you to input a new name.

#### Tab Icon
You can change the icon of a tab by clicking on one of the existing icons. This will open the [Icon Picker](./articles/pages.md#icon-picker).<br>
Tabs must have an icon, so selecting the empty icon will do nothing.

#### Tab Visibility
You can configure which tabs are visible to whom by clicking the visibility icon, this will change the visibility mode:

* :fontawesome-solid-eye: Visible: The tab will be visible to all players
* :fontawesome-solid-key: GM Only: The tab will only be visible to gamemasters
* :material-flash-auto: Auto: The tab will always be visible to gamemasters, and automatically for players (they will need to have at least one article with Limited [ownership](./articles/articles.md#ownership) or higher for the tab to show up)
* :fontawesome-regular-eye: Hidden: The tab will be hidden to all players

The visibility of the settings tab cannot be changed. It is not visible to players and always visible to gamemasters.

</div>

### Article Page Navigation
When articles get bigger and have multiple pages, a method is necessary to navigate through the articles.<br>
Worldbuilder offers 3 options;

* <b>Table of Contents - Sidebar</b>: A table of contents is located as a sidebar on the left of the article.
* <b>Table of Contents - Column</b>: A table of contents is located within the article window, as a column on the left.
* <b>Buttons</b>: Page buttons are located on the top.

You can navigate to a different page by pressing one of the page buttons, or by pressing the page in the table of contents. When one of the table of contents options is selected, pressing a page will scroll the article to the top of that page.<br>
The page headers in the table of contents are automatically generated, and pressing them will scroll the page to that header.
