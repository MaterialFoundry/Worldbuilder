# Worldbuilder Demo
Worldbuilder is a premium module, requiring a [Material Foundry Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/materialfoundry) subscription, however, a free [demo version](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/worldbuilder-demo) is available.

This demo version is identical to the full version in almost all respects, you can view, edit and create [articles](./articles/articles.md) and [widgets](./widgets/widgets.md), and can do pretty much everything you can do with the full version, with the following exceptions:

* Any changes that are made are reset on a refresh
* Importing, exporting and backups are disabled

This allows you to investigate if Worldbuilder is a suitable module for you without having to pay for a subscription.

!!! warning "Limitations when testing the demo with players"
    If you want to test Worldbuilder from the perspective of a player, you should load Foundry for both the player and the gamemaster at the same time before making edits.

    Any changes that are made by, for example, the gamemaster, will be lost for the player once they refresh.
